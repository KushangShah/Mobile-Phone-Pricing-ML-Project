## Dataset

The dataset includes features such as battery power, RAM, screen size, camera specifications, and more. Each record is labeled with a price range (0: Low, 1: Medium, 2: High, 3: Very High).


## Usage

Open and run the `mobilePhonePricing_ML.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter notebook mobilePhonePricing_ML.ipynb
```

Follow the notebook cells to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.
